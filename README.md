# MyGame

A small Terraria like game written using C# and OpenGL. It's still very incomplete but it does have working multiplayer, a few tiles that can be placed and a super simple server side entity.

Running it should be as simple as building using Visual Studio, starting the server first and then any time a client starts it will connect to the localhost.
