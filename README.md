# MyGame

A small Terraria like game written using C# and OpenGL. It's still very incomplete but it does have working multiplayer, a few tiles that can be placed and a super simple server side entity.

## Running

To run it first build it in visual studio and then run setup.bat which will create the required links to run the game. 
After that run the server from the server's build directory and then you can start a client from the client's build directory.

## Controls
Left click: Destory tiles
Right click: Place selected tile
0-9: Select the tile in the hotbar 

The grey box under "Reload chunk VBOs" can be moved dragged around the screen and clicking the small box will reload the VBOs for the chunk.
The other grey is just a simple check box.
